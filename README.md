## A basic Docker architecture for Symfony projects, using docker-compose

This is a simple Docker architecture that I made for Symfony projects.
It uses a Nginx as a web server, PHP-FPM and MySQL. The Symfony container is used to store the code in the local server.

## Configuration

If you'd like to use a specific version of any of the containers, feel free to edit the Dockerfile files in the Docker directory, but make sure you know what you're doing.

## Aiming

This repository aims at giving a base for Symfony projects. Feel free to clone it to create your own project, it's a base and you should be able to build any Symfony project with it.
However, let me know if you think a specific feature should be added and I may add it.

## Contributors

Please use github features to report issues or anything projet-related.
